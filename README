What is ratox?
==============

ratox is a client implementation of the rather popular tox protocol[0].
Unlike other clients relying on GUIs as an interface to the user, ratox is
developed with the UNIX-philosophy in mind and allows complete
interaction through named pipes.

There's also a set of scripts[1] developed by various people that build on
top of the FIFO interface.

Getting started
===============

Get the latest version from the git-repository; build and install it.
Run ratox in an empty directory and it will create a set of files and
folders allowing you to control the client.

File structure
==============

A typical filesystem structure is shown below along with some comments
to help explain the semantics of the individual files.

.
|-- .ratox.data			# ratox save file
|-- 0A734CBA717CEB7883D....	# friend's ID excluding nospam + checksum
|   |-- call_in			# arecord -r 48000 -c 1 -f S16_LE > call_in to initiate a call
|   |-- call_out		# aplay -r 48000 -c 1 -f S16_LE - < call_out to answer a call
|   |-- call_pending		# 1 if a call is pending, 0 otherwise
|   |-- file_in			# cat foo > file_in to send a file
|   |-- file_out		# cat file_out > bar to receive a file
|   |-- file_pending		# contains filename if transfer pending, empty otherwise
|   |-- name			# friend's nickname
|   |-- online			# 1 if friend online, 0 otherwise
|   |-- remove			# echo 1 > remove
|   |-- state			# {none,away,busy}
|   |-- status			# friend's status message
|   |-- text_in			# echo yo dude > text_in
|   `-- text_out		# tail -f text_out
|-- id				# our own ID

|   |-- err			# nickname related errors
|   |-- in			# echo my-new-nick > in
|   `-- out			# cat out to show your name
|-- nospam			# changing your nospam
|   |-- err			# nospam related errors
|   |-- in			# echo AABBCCDD > in
|   `-- out			# cat out to show your nospam
|-- request			# initiate/accept friend requests
|   |-- err			# request related errors
|   |-- in			# echo LONGASSID yo dude add me > in
|   `-- out			# echo 1 > out/LONGASSID to accept a request
|-- state			# changing your user state
|   |-- err			# user status related errors
|   |-- in			# echo away > in could be any of {none,away,busy}
|   `-- out			# cat out to show your user state
`-- status			# changing your status message
    |-- err			# status message related errors
    |-- in			# cat I am bored to death > in
