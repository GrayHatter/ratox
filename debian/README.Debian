Change of Proxy Address
------------------------

The upstream source defaults to '127.0.0.1:8080'. Since I assume that most of
my users also use Tor, I took the liberty of changing the port.

If this is not acceptable, fetch the source package, edit
debian/patches/0002-proxy-addr.patch and rebuild the package.
