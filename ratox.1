.Sh NAME
.Nm ratox
.Nd FIFO based tox client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46tp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a client implementation of the rather popular tox protocol.
Unlike other clients relying on GUIs as an interface to the user, ratox is
developed with the UNIX-philosophy in mind and allows complete
interaction through FIFOs.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Switch to IPv4-only mode.  This is the default.
.It Fl 6
Switch to IPv6-only mode.
.It Fl t
Enable TCP mode.  By default, tox operates with UDP and is recommended, as TCP mode implies certain security considerations.
.It Fl p
Enable TCP SOCKS5 proxy as specified in config.def.h when the package was built.
By default when this option is enabled, ratox will use a proxy on \fB127.0.0.1:8080\fR.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
is configured by modifying \fIconfig.h\fR and recompiling the code.  Apart from
the command line options there are a few more options that can be tweaked at compile
time.
.Pp
Encrypting the save file can be done by setting \fBencryptdatafile\fR to \fB1\fR.
You can do this even if your current save file is not encrypted.  The next time
.Nm
starts it will ask you to supply an encryption passphrase.
.Sh FILESYSTEM STRUCTURE
.Ss Global slots
Each of the following global slots contain an \fBin\fR, \fBout\fR and
\fBerr\fR file or directory respectively.  Piping data into the \fBin\fR FIFO
modifies the state of the respective slot.  If any output is expected it will
be found by reading \fBout\fR.  Errors are reported via \fBerr\fR.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Ar name/in
Change the name.
.It Ar name/out
Read the current name.
.It Ar nospam/in
Change the nospam value.
.It Ar nospam/out
Read the current nospam.
.It Ar state/in
Change the user state.  Possible values are \fBnone\fR,
\fBaway\fR and \fBbusy\fR.
.It Ar state/out
Read current user state.
.It Ar status/in
Change the status message.
.It Ar status/out
Read current status message.
.It Ar request/in
Initiate a friend request by echoing your friend's tox-id to the input FIFO.
.It Ar request/out/<tox-id>
Echo \fB1\fR or \fB0\fR to accept or reject the friend request respectively.
.El
.Ss Friend slots
Friend slots allow you to communicate with your friends.  They handle sending
text messages, files or starting a voice call.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Ar call_in
Initiate a call by attaching an audio source to this FIFO.  For example
arecord -r 48000 -c 1 -f S16_LE > \fBcall_in\fR.
.It Ar call_out
Answer an incoming call by piping it into an audio sink.  For example
aplay -r 48000 -c 1 -f S16_LE < \fBcall_out\fR.
.It Ar call_state
Reports the call state, possible values are \fBnone\fR, \fBpending\fR
and \fBactive\fR.
.It Ar file_in
Initiate a file transfer.  For example cat file > \fBfile_in\fR.
.It Ar file_out
Accept an incoming file transfer.  For example cat \fBfile_out\fR
> file.
.It Ar file_pending
Contains filename if transfer is pending, empty otherwise.
.It Ar name
The friend's name.
.It Ar online
It is \fB1\fR if the friend is online, \fB0\fR otherwise.
.It Ar remove
Echo \fB1\fR to remove a friend.
.It Ar state
The friend's user state.  Possible values are \fBnone\fR,
\fBaway\fR and \fBbusy\fR.
.It Ar status
The friend's status message.
.It Ar text_in
Send a text message to the friend by echoing data to this
FIFO.
.It Ar text_out
Receive text messages from the friend by reading from this
file.  For example tail -f \fBtext_out\fR.
